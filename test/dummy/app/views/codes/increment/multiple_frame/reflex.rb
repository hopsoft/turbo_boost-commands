# TurboReflex base superclass.
# All TurboReflex classes should inherit from this class.
#
# Reflexes are executed via a before_action in the Rails controller lifecycle.
# They have access to the following methods and properties.
#
# * dom_id ...................... The Rails dom_id helper
# * dom_id_selector ............. Returns a CSS selector for a dom_id
# * controller .................. The Rails controller processing the HTTP request
# * element ..................... A struct that represents the DOM element that triggered the reflex
# * morph ....................... Appends a Turbo Stream to morph a DOM element
# * params ...................... Reflex specific params (frame_id, element, etc.)
# * render ...................... Renders Rails templates, partials, etc. (doesn't halt controller request handling)
# * render_response ............. Renders a full controller response
# * renderer .................... An ActionController::Renderer
# * turbo_stream ................ A Turbo Stream TagBuilder
# * turbo_streams ............... A list of Turbo Streams to append to the response (also aliased as streams)
# * state ....................... An object that stores ephemeral `state`
#
# They also have access to the following class methods:
#
# * prevent_controller_action ... Prevents the rails controller/action from running (i.e. the reflex handles the response entirely)
#
