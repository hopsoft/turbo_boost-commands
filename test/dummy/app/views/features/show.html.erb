        Strict REST semantics for everything can have diminishing returns.
        TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> give you <em>more flexibility</em> by allowing you to "sprinkle"
        in remote procedure calls (RPC) when needed, reducing boilerplate and helping you focus on the task at hand.
      <% end %>

      <%= render "features/feature", icon: :square_3_stack_3d, heading: "Isolated Concerns" do %>
        Developing a <em>clean and maintainable</em> codebase is crucial.
        TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> help you avoid non-RESTful routes and minimize fat models and controllers.
        You'll write less code that's more organized, testable, and sustainable.
      <% end %>

      <%= render "features/feature", icon: :puzzle_piece, heading: "Seamless Integrations" do %>
        TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> have been designed to work perfectly with both Rails and Hotwire.
        They enhance your existing workflow...
        and you can introduce their game-changing techniques gradually to your current projects with <em>zero risk</em>.
      <% end %>

      <%= render "features/feature", icon: :hand_thumb_up, heading: "Standard Mechanics" do %>
        TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> are simply plain Ruby methods that are invoked by a Rails controller <code>before_action</code>.
        After they execute some discrete business logic, normal Rails behavior resumes control.
        It <em>couldn't be simpler</em>.
      <% end %>

      <%= render "features/feature", icon: :light_bulb, heading: "Conventional Concepts" do %>
        At a high level, TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> share the same mental model as popular client-side frameworks like React,
        but moving responsiblities to the server vastly <em>reduces the complexity</em> of triggering events, changing state, and re-rendering.
      <% end %>

      <%= render "features/feature", icon: :lightning_bolt, heading: "Reliable Protocols" do %>
        TurboBoost <i>Commands</i> use standard HTTP,
        so the tools you use for monitoring and optimizing normal web requests will also work for your reactive features...
        helping you build performant, reliable, and <em>great user experiences</em>.
