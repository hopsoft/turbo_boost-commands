## Why TurboBoost Commands?

Commands to help you build robust reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire.
They allow you to declaratively specify server methods that will execute when triggered by users *(think reactive applications)*.

TurboBoost Commands work with Hotwire's Turbo Frames.
They also work independent of frames.
You choose.

They let you *sprinkle* âœ¨ in reactive functionality and skip the ceremony of the typical
[REST semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
imposed by Rails conventions and Turbo Frames i.e. boilerplate *(routes, controllers, actions, etc...)*.

Commands are great for features adjacent to traditional RESTful resources.
Things like making selections, toggling switches, adding filters, etc...
**Basically for any feature where you've been tempted to create a non-RESTful action in a controller.**

Commands improve the developer experience (DX) of creating modern reactive applications.
They share the same mental model as React and other client side frameworks.
Namely,

1. **Trigger an event**
2. **Change state**
3. **(Re)render to reflect the new state**
4. *repeat...*

*The primary distinction being that __state is wholly managed by the server__.*

Commands are executed via Rails a `before_action` which means that reactivity runs over HTTP.
_**Web sockets are NOT used for the reactive critical path!** ðŸŽ‰_
This also means that standard Rails mechanics drive their behavior.

Also, commands can be tested in isolation or via Rails controller, integration, and system tests.

## Dependencies

- [rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails) `>=6.1`
- [turbo-rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/turbo-rails) `>=1.1`
- [@hotwired/turbo-rails](https://yarnpkg.com/package/@hotwired/turbo-rails) `>=7.1`
- [ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) `>=2.7`

## Setup

1. Add TurboBoost Commands dependencies

    ```diff
    # Gemfile
    gem "turbo-rails", ">= 1.1", "< 2"
    +gem "turbo_boost-commands", "~> VERSION"
    ```

    ```diff
    # package.json
    "dependencies": {
      "@hotwired/turbo-rails": ">=7.2",
    +  "@turbo-boost/commands": "^VERSION"
    ```

   *Be sure to install the __same version__ of the Ruby and JavaScript libraries.*

2. Import TurboBoost Commands in your JavaScript app

    ```diff
    # app/javascript/application.js
    import '@hotwired/turbo-rails'
    +import '@turbo-boost/commands'
    ```

2. Add TurboBoost Commands behavior to the Rails app

    ```diff
    # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
    <html>
      <head>
    +  <%= turbo_boost.meta_tag %>
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Usage

This example illustrates how to use TurboBoost Commands to manage upvotes on a Post.

1. **Trigger an event** - *register an element to listen for client side events that trigger server side commands*

    ```erb
    <!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->
    <%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(@post) do %>
      <a href="#" data-command="PostCommand#upvote">Upvote</a>
      Upvote Count: <%= @post.votes %>
    <% end %>
    ```

2. **Change state** - *create a server side command that modifies state*

    ```ruby
    # app/commands/post_command.rb
    class PostCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
      def upvote
        Post.find(controller.params[:id]).increment! :votes
      end
    end
    ```

3. **(Re)render to reflect the new state** - *normal Rails / Turbo Frame behavior runs and (re)renders the frame*

### Command Triggers

TurboBoost Commands use [event delegation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_delegation) to capture client side events that invoke server side commands.

Here is the list of default events and respective elements that TurboBoost Commands monitors.

- **`change`** - `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`
- **`submit`** - `<form>`
- **`click`** - `*` *all other elements*

It's possible to override these defaults like so.

```js
// restrict `click` monitoring to <a> and <button> elements
TurboBoost.Commands.registerEventDelegate('click', ['a[data-command]', 'button[data-command]'])
```

You can also register custom events and elements.
Here's an example that sets up monitoring for the `sl-change` event on the `sl-switch` element from the [Shoelace web component library](https://shoelace.style/).

```js
TurboBoost.Commands.registerEventDelegate('sl-change', ['sl-switch[data-command]'])
```

### Lifecycle Events

TurboBoost Commands support the following lifecycle events.

- `turbo-boost:command:start` - fires before the command is sent to the server
- `turbo-boost:command:finish` - fires after the server has executed the command and responded
- `turbo-boost:command:error` - fires if an unexpected error occurs

### Targeting Frames

TurboBoost Commands target the [`closest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) `<turbo-frame>` element by default,
but you can also explicitly target other frames just like you normally would with Turbo Frames.

1. Look for `data-turbo-frame` on the command element

    ```erb
    <input type="checkbox"
      data-command="ExampleCommand#work"
      data-turbo-frame="some-frame-id">
    ```

1. Find the closest `<turbo-frame>` to the command element

    ```erb
    <turbo-frame id="example-frame">
      <input type="checkbox" data-command="ExampleCommand#work">
    </turbo-frame>
    ```

### Working with Forms

TurboBoost Commands work great with Rails forms.
Just specify the `data-command` attribute on the form.

```erb
# app/views/posts/post.html.erb
<%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(@post) do %>
  <%= form_with model: @post, data: { command: "ExampleCommand#work" } do |form| %>
    ...
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(@post) do %>
  <%= form_for @post, remote: true, data: { command: "ExampleCommand#work" } do |form| %>
    ...
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= form_with model: @post,
  data: { turbo_frame: dom_id(@post), command: "ExampleCommand#work" } do |form| %>
  ...
<% end %>
```

### Server Side Commands

The client side DOM attribute `data-command` indicates what Ruby class and method to invoke.
*The attribute value is specified with RDoc notation. i.e. `ClassName#method_name`*

Here's an example.

```erb
<a data-command="DemoCommand#example">
```

Server side commands can live anywhere in your app; however, we recommend you keep them in the `app/commands` directory.

```diff
 |- app
 |  |- ...
+|  |- commands
 |  |- controllers
 |  |- helpers
 |  |- ...
```

Commands are simple Ruby classes that inherit from `TurboBoost::Commands::Command`.
They expose the following instance methods and properties.

```ruby
# * dom_id ...................... The Rails dom_id helper
# * dom_id_selector ............. Returns a CSS selector for a dom_id
# * controller .................. The Rails controller processing the HTTP request
# * element ..................... A struct that represents the DOM element that triggered the command
# * morph ....................... Appends a Turbo Stream to morph a DOM element
# * params ...................... Commands specific params (frame_id, element, etc.)
# * render ...................... Renders Rails templates, partials, etc. (doesn't halt controller request handling)
# * render_response ............. Renders a full controller response
# * renderer .................... An ActionController::Renderer
# * turbo_stream ................ A Turbo Stream TagBuilder
# * turbo_streams ............... A list of Turbo Streams to append to the response (also aliased as streams)
# * state ....................... An object that stores ephemeral `state`
```

```ruby
# app/commands/demo_command.rb
class DemoCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
  # The command method is invoked by an ActionController `before_action`.
  def example
    # - execute business logic
    # - update state
    # - append additional Turbo Streams
  end
end
```

### Appending Turbo Streams

It's possible to append additional Turbo Streams to the response from within a command.
Appended streams are added to the response body **after** the Rails controller action has completed and rendered the view template.

```ruby
# app/commands/demo_command.rb
class DemoCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
  def example
    # logic...
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.append("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.prepend("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.replace("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.update("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.remove("dom_id")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.before("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.after("dom_id", "CONTENT")
    turbo_streams << turbo_stream.invoke("console.log", args: ["Whoa! ðŸ¤¯"])
  end
end
```

*This proves especially powerful when paired with [TurboBoost Streams](https://github.com/hopsoft/turbo_boost-streams).*

> ðŸ“˜ **NOTE:** `turbo_stream.invoke` is a [TurboBoost Streams](https://github.com/hopsoft/turbo_boost-streams#usage) feature.

### Setting Instance Variables

It can be useful to set instance variables on the Rails controller from within a command.

Here's an example that shows how to do this.

```erb
<!-- app/views/posts/index.html.erb -->
<%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(@posts) do %>
  <%= check_box_tag :all, :all, @all, data: { command: "PostsCommand#toggle_all" } %>
  View All

  <% @posts.each do |post| %>
    ...
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

```ruby
# app/commands/posts_command.rb
class PostsCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
  def toggle_all
    posts = element.checked ? Post.all : Post.unread
    controller.instance_variable_set(:@all, element.checked)
    controller.instance_variable_set(:@posts, posts)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts ||= Post.unread
  end
end
```

### Prevent Controller Action

Sometimes you may want to prevent normal response handling.

For example, consider the need for a related but separate form that updates a subset of user attributes.
We'd like to avoid creating a non RESTful route
but aren't thrilled at the prospect of adding REST boilerplate for a new route, controller, action, etc...

In that scenario we can reuse an existing route and prevent normal response handling with a command.

Here's how to do it.

```erb
<!-- app/views/users/show.html.erb -->
<%= turbo_frame_tag "user-alt" do %>
  <%= form_with model: @user, data: { command: "UserCommand#example" } do |form| %>
    ...
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

The form above will send a `PATCH` request to `users#update`,
but we'll prevent normal request handling in the command to prevent running `users#update` in the controller.

```ruby
# app/commands/user_command.html.erb
class UserCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
  def example
    # business logic, save record, etc...
    controller.render html: "<turbo-frame id='user-alt'>We prevented the normal response!</turbo-frame>".html_safe
  end
end
```

Remember that commands are invoked by a controller [before action filter](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters).
That means controller rendering from inside a command halts the standard request cycle.

### Broadcasting Turbo Streams

You can also broadcast Turbo Streams to subscribed users from a command.

```ruby
# app/commands/demo_command.rb
class DemoCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command
  def example
    # logic...
    Turbo::StreamsChannel
      .broadcast_invoke_later_to "some-subscription", "console.log", args: ["Whoa! ðŸ¤¯"]
  end
end
```

*Learn more about Turbo Stream broadcasting by reading through the
[hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/blob/main/app/models/concerns/turbo/broadcastable.rb) source code.*

> ðŸ“˜ **NOTE:** `broadcast_invoke_later_to` is a [TurboBoost Streams](https://github.com/hopsoft/turbo_boost-streams#broadcasting) feature.
